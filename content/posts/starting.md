I recently discovered SRCL, an incredible open-source React component library for building applications with terminal aesthetics. In this post, I'll walk you through how I set up this blog.

SRCL (Sacred React Component Library) provides a complete set of UI components that mimic the look and feel of classic terminal interfaces. The clean, monospace design gives your site a distinctive retro vibe while maintaining excellent readability.

To get started, I added the SRCL repository as a Git submodule and configured my Vite project to use it. The integration was surprisingly smooth, and I was able to create this blog in just a few hours.

The components I've found most useful so far are:

- **CardDouble** - For creating post containers
- **Breadcrumbs** - For navigation trails
- **Avatar** - For author information
- **Divider** - For separating content sections

I'm still exploring all the possibilities, but I'm already impressed with how flexible and well-designed this system is.
